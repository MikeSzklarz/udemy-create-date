# Overview

Udemy courses only show updated dates for the course but not the creation date. This is a simple extension that adds the creation date of the course to the course page. 

## Running this extension

1. Clone this repository.
2. Load this directory in Chrome as an [unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked).
3. Navigate to a Udemy course page.
4. The extension will automatically inject a script into the page that retrieves the course creation date and displays it on the page.
